As a team we created an [app](https://kevinwork98.shinyapps.io/kkdc-dish_app/) that takes a look into the past (1900-1910). We used modern visualizations to provide the user with a closer look at the restaurant scene of the past. The seamlessly integrated searches and graphics provide a current representation of a historic data set. The distribution of different dishes and restaurants can give the user a sense of the time period. An auto-complete function was also added for user convenience.

### Datasets used
  * New York Libraries "Whats on the Menu" datasets
    * Transcribed historic menus
  * Google Places API - for precise locations
