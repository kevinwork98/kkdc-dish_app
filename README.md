This application shows New York restaurants between 1900- 1910. The data we used is from the New York Public Library's "Whats on the Menu" dataset. This dataset featured an extensive collection of transcribed historical menus. The application is able to show the specific restaurants
that served a specific dish. Our application also features an auto-complete function where it will try to guess what the user will type.

This application can be used to show the distribution of dishes and to see if certain dishes were concentrated in a certain part of New York City.
